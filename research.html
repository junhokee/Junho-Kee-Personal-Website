      <h2>  Reliable Electrocardiogram-based Seizure Detection using Multi-Modal Electroencephalography-Electrocardiogram Representation Learning with Intra-Triplet Loss
</h2>

      <p>As more people are suffering from epilepsy and seizures by the year, 
        ways to cure or detect these sudden seizure attacks are becoming a vital issue. 
        Current methods of medical treatment or seizure detection devices are not practical, 
        though: the current epilepsy treatment is very costly and the most direct way of detecting
         seizures, electroencephalography–the method of detecting electrical signals from the 
         brain–is also expensive and inconvenient. Thus, I propose to use an alternate method, 
         utilizing a seizure-detection algorithm that utilizes electrocardiography–which detects
          the electrical signals from the heart–trained by EEG seizure-detection algorithm as EEG
           is relatively much simpler to detect patterns before sudden seizures from occurring. I
            trained the algorithms by utilizing previously discovered seizure-detecting convolutional 
            neural networks and by testing three different loss functions to discover the best 
            performing method. In the final analysis, the DenseNet-169 algorithm performed the 
            best with 90.53% accuracy utilizing the inter squared and intra squared loss functions 
            together.</p>

      <h2>Unsupervised Gaze Representation Learning with Conjugate
  Gaze Consistency Loss for Enhanced Gaze Estimation</h2>
      <p>Patients suffering from quadriplegia and other paralysis that interfere with the 
        ability to communicate have been increasing for the past decade, and in turn, the 
        need for better communication boards have been growing. Current communication boards,
         both physical and digital communication boards, all have flaws starting from the 
         need of an assistant to the sole expense of the device. However, gaze estimation
          techniques have also been gaining attention to enhance the quality of
           communication boards by tracking the movement of the eye via a camera to assess 
           what the user is trying to communicate. Previous studies on gaze estimation 
           algorithms have shown that collecting data for accurate gaze values is an arduous
            task, and that the accuracy of the gaze estimation models has been unsatisfactory
             for practical use. Thus, I propose a gaze estimation-based digital communication
              board system that combines gaze representation learning with transfer learning.
               In the representation learning phase, I introduce a random sign-reversal module
                to efficiently isolate gaze-related features. In the transfer learning phase, 
                I implement a medically driven loss function to enhance the system's accuracy.
                 The proposed system achieved an angular error of 9.42 degrees which represents
                  state-of-the-art performance compared to previous studies.</p>
